## About


The project is designed to demonstrate some skills in ML: conducting Exploratory Data Analysis, building predictive machine learning models, formalizing the results of the research in the form of a web service using Streamlit and FastApi frameworks and remote PostgreSQL database.     

It has created as part of the ["Линейные модели и их презентация"](https://stepik.org/course/177215/syllabussyllabus) course offered by [AI Education](https://stepik.org/course/177213) on Stepik education platform.

It is devoted to analytical research of bank users, as well as prediction of their behavior using machine learning methods with visualization of the obtained results in the form of WEB application. 

You can use the app just visit https://bank-clients-fastapi.streamlit.app/


## Structure

The project consists of three parts:
1. **Research** (notebooks folder). Here you can find notebooks with EDA about bank customers, and experiments on training predictive models of bank customer behavior.
2. **Backend** as FastAPI app (backend folder). Here you can find designing endpoints and trained models
3. **Frantend** as Streamlit app (frontend folder). Here lies the design of the application interface: the function to plot, visualize, and interface interaction with models and user selection
